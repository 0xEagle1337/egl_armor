🛡 egl_armor // ESX & QBCore Compatible Ballistic Vest Enhancement Script

This script enriches the experience for players on FiveM servers using ESX or QBCore by introducing a realistic feature where ballistic protection is applied only when a ballistic vest, categorized under Body Armor, is worn. It simulates the action of inserting ballistic plates into the vest, turning standard clothing items into functional protective gear.

# 🌟 Features

    Realistic Ballistic Protection: Players can enhance their ballistic vests by using specific items, representing ballistic plates, to gain actual ballistic protection.
    Requirement for Actual Vest: Ensures ballistic protection is only provided when wearing an allowed vest from the Body Armor category, enhancing realism.
    ESX and QBCore Compatibility: Seamlessly integrates with the most popular frameworks, ensuring wide server compatibility.
    Intuitive Use: Interaction is straightforward, through the player's inventory, with no need for a complex user interface.
    Configurable Protection Levels: Administrators can set the armor value for each plate item, tailoring the level of protection to gameplay needs.
